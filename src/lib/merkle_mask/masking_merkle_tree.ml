    (* we would want fold_until to combine results from the parent and the mask
       way (1): use the parent result as the init of the mask fold (or
         vice-versa) the parent result may be of different type than the mask
         fold init, so we get a less general type than the signature indicates,
         so compilation fails
       way (2): make the folds independent, but there's not a specified way to
         combine the results
       way (3): load parent accounts into an in-memory list, merge with mask
         accounts, then fold; this becomes intractable if the parent has a large
         number of entries *)
